# MiniPyFT8 
This repo contains a minimised FT8 decoder written entirely in Python. 

It is a derivative of my fuller decoder PyFT8 which includes transmit capability but no waterfall. Please see the readme in that repo for more information.

## Acknowledgements
This project implements a decoder for the FT8 digital mode. FT8 was developed by Joe Taylor, K1JT, Steve Franke, K9AN, and others as part of the WSJT-X project.
Protocol details are based on information publicly described by the WSJT-X authors and in related open documentation.

Some constants and tables (e.g. Costas synchronization sequence, LDPC structure, message packing scheme) are derived from 
the publicly available WSJT-X source code and FT8 protocol descriptions. Original WSJT-X source is © the WSJT Development Group 
and distributed under the GNU General Public License v3 (GPL-3.0), hence the use of GPL-3.0 in this repository.
